# Content Progress Card

This is a working content progress card. The functionality is dynamic and would adapt to the amount of inputs used in the html. The styling however isnt adapting to the amount of inputs for now and would need a little tweaking if more inputs are to be added. 

Languages used: HTML, LESS, jQuery
